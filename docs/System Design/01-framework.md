System design interviews are designed to be subjective. The problems are generally scaled massively and nobody really expects you to solve them. So what is it all about?

Well, System design interviews are designed to evaluate the candidate's skill at designing a real-world software system with various components.

The interviewer has worked and brewed the problem for weeks, if not months. What they are interested is your approach, your analytical skills and how do you approach a problem.

Considering an interview usually lasts 60 minutes, introduction and closing questions leave us with just 40-50 minutes of time to work on the problem. So, it's crucial to have a framework in mind on how you approach the problem.
